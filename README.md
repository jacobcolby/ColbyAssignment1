Computer Graphics Assignment 1

In the reading, I learned:

- The framebuffer is one of the six major elements in a graphics system. I think I would have been able to name the other five elements but I was unaware of the framebuffer.

- The cathode-ray tube was the most used type of display until recently.

- Pipeline architectures used custom VLSI circuits for graphics displays.

- The pipeline doubles the throughput of the system and significantly shortens the calculation time.

- The geomtric pipeline goes as: Vertex Processor > Clipper and Primitive Assembler > Rasterizer > Fragment Processor > Pixels.
